There can be a list of previous email campaigns and create a new one by clicking the **"New Automation"** button.

**Fill in all the necessary information on the feature page**

You can name and write a short description for your automation email campaign. Remember to put a checkmark next to “Activate this automation”.

In the “Trigger & Template” option, you can choose any template and trigger event that was previously set and created. 

In the email options, you can add up to 10 emails for both BCC and CC emails. 

**Have creative and attractive content for the email campaign**

Being free to create email content allows you to inform your customers of all the updated news, and do branding and promotions at the same time. 

***Sample:***

*Dear [your customer’s name]*

*This email lets you know - your order [number of order] has been canceled for these items due to [give a reason for canceling]*

*[List of refund items]*

*As per our policy, [mention your cancellation policy]. You will also be expecting a refund of {amount} by {date}. Pay with cash for a refund upon delivery* 

*The detailed order and refund will be attached.*

*Your order has been canceled for these items. If you think it is a mistake, please contact us immediately.* 

*Moreover, you can also take a look at our newest products, which could be a wonderful alternative.* 

***[List of the newest products]***

*Kindly request to please confirm the cancellation and refund.* 

*Best regards.* 

***Store’s name***

**Set start and end date**

You can set start date of the email campaign.

Remember to **set an end date** if it is necessary to stop the automated delivery. Only when you put a checkmark into the check box “Set end date”, you will be allowed to pick two different dates for starting and ending the campaign. 

**Note that:** The rule will never end until the end date is set. 

After you've finished all the settings for your automation email campaign, don't forget to click "Save" to officially activate your campaign, which will allow you to easily save time and effort later, and easily increase your brand identity.
