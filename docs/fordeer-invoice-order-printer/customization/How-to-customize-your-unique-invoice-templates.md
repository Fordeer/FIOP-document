**Show logo** 

Put a checkmark in the checkbox “Show logo”. Just with one click, your company’s logo will be displayed on the billing documents.

In the template, the previously set logo will be immediately filled in. You can adjust the logo size as you desire. 

**Primary color**

There are a number of things that could be shown with the color you choose. 

Not only the available color bar, but you also can use your favorite color or the primary color of your business by putting a checkmark in the checkbox “Use custom color”

**Fonts**

There is a font system available that you can apply to your documents. More than that, you can also use your own font by putting a checkmark in “I have another font.” Then, you enter your font URL on the blank bar to apply your font.

Moreover, you can also modify the font size and line height. 

### **Attract your customers with a “Thank you note”**

With this option, you can create a special "thank you note" that expresses your brand's message. This part allows you to make a great impression on your customers. 

After you've finished customizing, don't forget to click "Save" to have your own billing templates, which will allow you to easily increase your brand identity.
