### How to brand and style your billing documents?

Be unique, and only by customizing your invoice templates. Following this step-by-step guide, you will own beautiful templates for your brand.

On the sidebar menu, click **“Templates”** then click **“Customize”** to start. 

Select the template that you want to brand & style.

**Show logo** 

Put a checkmark in the checkbox “Show logo”. Just with one click, your company’s logo will be displayed on the billing documents. 

In the template, the previously set logo will be immediately filled in. Additionally, you may define any other characteristics and adjust the logo's width and height.
