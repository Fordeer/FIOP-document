About 40 years ago, e-commerce was first introduced to the world. Today, many people regularly purchase online, and some even prefer online shops to traditional brick-and-mortar stores. Thus, e-commerce has created a wide range of opportunities for business owners, since it is now easier than ever to launch an online store and run an e-commerce business.

One of the most well-known e-commerce systems available is [Shopify](https://apps.shopify.com/fordeer-data-export?st_source=autocomplete/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=traffic). Shopify is an all-inclusive, hosted e-commerce platform that provides tools for creating an online shop, selling goods, and taking payments from consumers. Moreover, it's a full-featured website builder and online store manager with tools for managing orders, advertising your business, and monitoring customer purchasing patterns. The monthly cost of Shopify ranges from $9 to $299, with the greatest value being the $79 per month Shopify plan.

It is not challenging to see that Shopify sellers usually have to struggle with time-consuming invoice issues. Thus, it has become crucial for any business to maintain an accurate and proper invoicing system. With the Shopify app, billing is now easier and more effective than ever.

Customers will use invoices to determine how much to pay you and the terms of the transaction. Invoices will also help you keep track of your sales and any taxes you may have collected. However, if you don't understand them correctly and find the right template for your business operation, they can become a big issue. Most significantly, it enhances your store‚Äôs professional awareness. The days of Excel or paper-based invoices are long gone. The invoicing software available today enables you to perform a large number of tasks.
