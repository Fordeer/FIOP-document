# How to create metafield definitions

By enabling you to record customized data that is typically not captured in the Shopify admin, metafields enable you to customize the functioning and appearance of your Shopify store. Metafields can be used in a variety of ways, such as to display specialized information on your online store or for internal tracking. 

For instance, a seller of candles could wish to include the burn time for their candles on their product pages, while a grocery store might want to display a product expiration date for canned goods.

This instruction will show you how to create metafields easily on Shopify. 

### Create metafield definitions

On the side bar of homepage, go to “**Settings**” and access “**Custom data**”
