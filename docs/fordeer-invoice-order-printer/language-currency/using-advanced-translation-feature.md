# Using advanced Translation feature


This guideline will give you information about our advanced translation feature. 

With this feature, you can directly edit and update the translation while customizing the templates.

The **“Automatically translate”** is always turned on. Thus, the translation displayed in the documents will be the previously set-up version. 

If you want to edit directly when customizing, click or swipe to **turn it off**.
