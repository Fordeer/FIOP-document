# How to display PO number on the invoice?

A PO number, or purchase order number, is a specific reference code that's assigned to a purchase so that it can be tracked throughout the order process. PO numbers are found on purchase order documents and are legally binding, helping both the business and the buyer reference their orders easily.

These instructions will show you how to display the PO number on the invoice templates of your Shopify store.

On the sidebar, click “**Templates**” to go to the Templates gallery. Then select the template that you want to customize and click “**Customize**”
