Remember to **set an end date** if it is necessary to stop the automated delivery. Only when you put a checkmark into the check box “Set end date”, you will be allowed to pick two different dates for starting and ending the campaign. 

**Note that:** The rule will never end until the end date is set. 

After you've finished all the settings for your automation email campaign, don't forget to click "Save" to officially activate your campaign, which will allow you to easily save time and effort later, and easily increase your brand identity.
