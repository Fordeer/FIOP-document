# Why there are no pop ups showing?

First of all, kindly make sure that you have enabled App Embed on the **Shopifyâ€™s Theme Editor.**

If you have done this step, please go the **Dashboard** on the side bar menu, then you can easily choose the status of the popup by putting a checkmark in the checkbox in **Status** column.

You can choose to show a popup by switching the button to the right and vice versa.
