As you can see when first accessing **Sales Pop**, there are some options that you can change to suit your needs and your shop store. Besides that, you can obviously see the demo pop-up at the right corner of your screen. You can easily switch between *Computer view* and *Mobile phone view* to examine the compatibility of the sales pop with your devices.
