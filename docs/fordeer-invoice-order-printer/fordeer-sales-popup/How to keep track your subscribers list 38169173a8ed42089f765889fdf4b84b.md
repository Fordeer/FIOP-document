# How to keep track your subscribers list?

Whenever a visitor adds their email to the **opt-in popup form**, they will be added to your customer list in your **Shopify Customer**. Fordeer Popups provides a list of all customers who have signed up through your opt-in popup form, with a link to each customer's profile in your Shopify Admin.

From the dashboard, go to **Subscribers** - here you will see a list of all customers who have subscribed through the popup. Their email, phone, subscription date are displayed here.
