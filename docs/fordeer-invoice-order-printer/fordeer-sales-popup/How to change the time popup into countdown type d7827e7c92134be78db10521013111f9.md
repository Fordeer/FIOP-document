**You can choose 2 countdown types** 

- **Specific end date**: You have to set up the end date then our system will identify and import information in the popup. You can see a demo on the right of your screen.

- **Loop interval**: The frequency or duration at which the countdown updates or refreshes. For example, if the countdown is set to 2 days, and the loop interval time is 18 hours, the countdown will update every second, showing the remaining time as it counts down from **2** days **18** hrs 00 mins 00 secs to **2** days **17** hrs 59 mins 59, and so on until it reaches 00:00.
