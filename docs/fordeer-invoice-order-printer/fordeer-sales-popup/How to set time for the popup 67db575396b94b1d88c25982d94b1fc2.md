# How to set time for the popup?

Website owners may use multiple popups in a sequence to deliver different messages, promotions, or calls to action to users. By setting a specific time between each popup, they can control the frequency at which popups appear to users.

Put a checkmark in the checkbox **Random delay time between popups**. Just with one click, you can set up random delay time between each popup.

There are some fields in this option you need to know, I will list the meaning of them below:

1. **Min delay**: the minimum of delay time between each popup
2. **Max delay**: the maximum of delay time between each popup
3. **Duration of a popup**: the length of time that a popup remains visible on a website before it automatically disappears or closes.
4. **Delay before first pop shows**: the time interval or waiting period before the first popup on each page is initially displayed on a website after a specific trigger event occurs.

On the other hand, if you want to set up time by yourself, please remove a check mark in the checkbox **Random delay time between popups**.

Here are some phrases you need to know when you manually fix the delay time.

1. **Time between each popup**: the duration that passes between the display of one popup and the appearance of the next popup on a website.  â‡’ If popups appear too frequently and without enough time for users to engage with each one, it may lead to frustration and a negative perception of the website. On the other hand, if the time between each popup is too long, users may lose interest, and the effectiveness of the popups as a marketing or engagement tool may drop off.
2. **Duration of a popup**: how long a popup will last
3. **Delay before first pop shows:** the first pop up will be appeared after a selected time.
