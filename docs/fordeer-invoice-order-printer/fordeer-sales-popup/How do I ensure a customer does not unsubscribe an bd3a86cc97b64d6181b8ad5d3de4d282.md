# How do I ensure a customer does not unsubscribe and re-subscribe to get additional discounts?

At the **Goal** setting in the **Popup** page, after choosing S**ubscribe to show discount code**, kindly put a check mark on **Sync with Shopify customers**. 

After doing this steps, your customers information in our app will be synced with **Customers** in your **Shopify**. Thus, your customer unsubscribes they will not be able to use the same email address to sign up again.
