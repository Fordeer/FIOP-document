# How many types of cart countdown?

<aside>
â›” Cart Countdown only works with themes which have AJAX cart (stay on current page after adding to cart). This app does not work if theme automatically redirects to cart page after adding products to cart.

</aside>

There are 2 types of cart countdown available in our app: **Notification Bar** and **Alert Box**

### Notification Bar

The notification bar will only show on the top of the Cart page, as you can see from the picture above.

### Alert Box

The alert box always is sticky on edge of all pages and it can be collapsed to show timer only.
