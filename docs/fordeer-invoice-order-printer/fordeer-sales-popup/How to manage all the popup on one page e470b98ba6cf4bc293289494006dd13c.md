# How to manage all the popup on one page?

Please go to the **Dashboard** on the sidebar menu to manage all apps and their activities. Thus, you can easily follow your shopâ€™s performance and offer some strategies suitable for your shop.

You can change the popupâ€™s name directly at the dashboard instead of going to the **Applications**. Moreover, you can easily choose the status of the popup by putting a checkmark in the checkbox in the **Status** column.

In addition, you can click ðŸ“Š in **Analytics** column to see your shop impressions and engagements.
