# How to edit the popup content?

Stay at the **Sales Pop** page and click the **Setting** option. 

Here you can edit the default content and language on the sales popup to meet your needs, and the system only supports 2-line content. The layout of the sales pop will be broken if you add a 3-line message.

Please **DO NOT** change the variables **CUSTOMER**, **LOCATION**, and **PRODUCT**. You can rearrange these variables or remove the variable you don't want to appear on the sale pop.
