# How to import order data to show on Sales Pop?

Kindly click the **Data** option. You can use your real order directly imported from **Shopify Orders** or create your own orders list to make customer FOMO. 

1. On the first option: **Automatic** (Import from Shopify Orders) coming soon
2. On the second option: **Manual** (Create your own orders list)

This choice will allow you to create your own order list thus you can generate unlimited orders manually. You can use **Manual** import to add products list, customer name list, location list, and time list if you don't have enough orders available. Your data will be mixed together to create a random sales pop.
